# scouting-app
This is the app used for scouting. It's written in react native using expo.

# Installation
Make sure you have a new version of `nodejs` and `npm` installed. In order to test the app you must install a few libraries. Start by installing `expo-cli` with
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
You might need to run it as root. Then git clone this repository with
```
git clone https://github.com/Arctos6135/scouting-app.git
cd scouting-app
```
You can run the expo server with
```
npm start
```
It will open the QR code in you browser and you can scan that with the expo app on your phone to see the app.
